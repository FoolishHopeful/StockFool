<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The world wants us to believe that investing is hard. Don’t get me wrong, it is. But there are ways to significantly reduce the level of difficulty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One way to make investing easier is to expand your time horizon. The more decisions you make, the more often you’re going to be wrong. It’s as simple as that. Expanding your time horizon tends to reduce activity and sharpen your focus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another way is to buy the world’s greatest companies. Pull up a stock chart for any company that you consider great, and I will almost guarantee that it has an upward sloping trajectory over long periods of time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These easy-to-implement suggestions do not have to be independent of each other. Indeed, combine the two and you’re on your way to solving what many a pundit wants you to believe is a near impossible endeavour.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This philosophy has underpinned a number of our recommendations thus far, and we’re implementing it again by adding <meta charset="utf-8">[stock display="<strong>Starbucks</strong> (NASDAQ:SBUX)" symbol="SBUX" type="bar" ] to our collection. A hidden gem this is not, but there’s no doubt it is a gem. Starbucks has generated wonderful long-term returns for its investors, and with multiple growth levers at its disposal, there’s little reason to believe this won’t continue—possibly for decades (yes, decades) to come. While the company’s products help millions get through the day-to-day rigours of life, in our minds, owning this stock will do similar wonders for your portfolio.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a></a>The business</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast to many of our recommendations, Starbucks needs little in the way of introduction. There’s a good chance many of you are even customers. After all, this is a company that set out 30 years ago to create the “third place”—an ecosystem outside home and work—by leveraging specialty coffee, seemingly filling a hole in the market left after the television show Cheers (the place where everyone knew your name) went off the air.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Starbucks has become much more than a place where people flock to get their daily coffee (or five). You might be surprised to learn of the number of brands that have been assembled under the flagship banner over the years. These include Teavana, Tazo, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Evolution Fresh, La Boulange, Ethos, and Frappuccino.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The offerings available within the more than 24,000 stores in the Starbucks chain have also evolved over the years. Frequent visitors know that fresh food and snack offerings have become a significant part of the mix, as well as serve-ware and beverage-making equipment. Starbucks has also leveraged its significant brand by licensing its trademarks through a variety of grocery and food-service accounts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What started as a single location in 1971 and began to take shape in August 1987, when long-time and current CEO Howard Schultz came on board, has morphed into was is unquestionably the most dominant and disruptive force in the world of coffee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a></a>The opportunity</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When we hear that word disruptive, things like 3D-printing or autonomous automobiles tend to come to mind. Coffee shops generally don’t. However, since Schultz entered the fray, that’s exactly what he’s done to an otherwise staid category. And that’s exactly where Starbucks’s opportunity lies—the continued disruption of the coffee shop industry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This has been, and continues to be, a multi-pronged attack. Perhaps the most important front is associated with international expansion. It’s no secret that the U.S. (and Canada for that matter) are closer to the point of Starbucks saturation than not. To be clear, there’s still some room for growth within both, but the opportunity has narrowed significantly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The company long ago recognized this and began allocating significant resources to growth outside its legacy market(s). Growth on the international front has seen the company’s footprint expand across the globe, but the story has really only begun. China, with 2,300 locations spread across 100 cities, is perhaps the best example of the opportunity that continues to exist. To illustrate (and this is purely illustrative), consider that the town in which I reside has a population of 20,000 and one Starbucks location. China has 1.4 billion people. Based on the same ratio, one day there could be 70,000 Starbucks in China alone!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t like the word never, but I think it’s pretty safe to say that this will never happen. I also think it’s safe to say, however, that given the company is confident that it’s made major headway into the whole morning coffee ritual in China (disrupting rituals past), the opportunity goes well beyond the current 2,300 locations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beyond international expansion, the other disruptive force that Starbucks brings to the table is its use of technology. This is a company that was very early to adopt mobile pay and, more recently, has introduced an increasingly sophisticated loyalty program. The days of punch card loyalty systems at Fran’s Diner are long gone. And while the number of Starbucks outlets in North America may be approaching the saturation point, thanks to the company’s troves of data, its ability to either extract more from you and me during each visit or entice us to visit more often is gaining strength. This high-tech approach is also being deployed across the globe, helping to build a moat that’s likely to be tough to bridge for any would-be challengers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a></a>Valuation</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Great companies don’t always make for great stocks. Typically the reason for this comes down to valuation. Overpay for a great company, and there’s a good chance you’ll regret it. Thanks to a pullback over the past three months or so, Starbucks currently trades at a level that has historically proven to be a fine entry point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, I’m not sure you’ll ever catch me calling a company that trades at 25 times forward earnings “cheap.” However, relative to the rest of the market, that multiple looks pretty darn attractive. Starbucks trades at 142% of the 18 times forward earnings that the S&amp;P 500 currently trades. Relative to the historic relationship between these multiples, this is low. The five-year average premium is 180%, and this metric was as high as 200% in early 2015. All else equal, a return to the average would bump the stock by 26%. At the very least, it’s reasonable to assume a degree of pessimism is built into Starbucks’s stock at current levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a></a>Risks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m hesitant to highlight this given our long-term investment philosophy; however, I think the short-term risks associated with Starbucks are far more significant than the long term. All this means is that when you’re buying the stock, it may prove wise to leave some room to buy more at a later date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My thinking is based on the market’s relentless focus on Starbucks’s same-store-sales (SSS) growth, especially in the U.S. A print under 5% for the first time in 25 quarters is blamed for the recent stumble by the stock, and, frankly, this could well happen again. After scanning through a few sell-side reports, it’s clear this is all the analysts are focused on. Therefore, a “disappointing” SSS quarterly print in the months ahead could add pressure. It’s important to understand, though, that while this may grab headlines, it’s very unlikely to sway our long-term outlook given the growth levers alluded to earlier—all of which are going to play out over many years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A more significant risk, in our minds, is the fact that CEO Schultz is 63 and potentially nearing the end of the line. Growing companies require a specific type of leader who is both a visionary and a realist with the ability to make hard decisions in the face of adversity. Schultz has a track record of doing just that (including when he returned to the company in 2008 after stepping down in 2000). Although he is showing no signs of leaving yet, his eventual departure is arguably the largest risk shareholders face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a></a>Foolish bottom line</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starbucks offers a fantastic example of how our long-term investment philosophy provides an edge. If we cared a lick about what the SSS print might be in the next quarter, or a year from now even, I’m not sure we’d be recommending this company. But for those willing to ignore the noise and recognize the opportunity that lies in front of the company and the groundwork in place to ensure it comes to fruition, this is a potentially ideal time to begin building a position. While the market is focused on the here and now, we see great things transpiring for both the company and the stock for the next decade and beyond. We’re happy to be ordering up shares and hope that you’ll join us.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expectations were pretty muted for Starbucks [stock display="(NASDAQ:SBUX)" symbol="SBUX" type="bar" ] heading into its fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings report, released on July 26 after market close. This was in large part because the company already let the cat out of the bag, pre-reporting a handful of metrics on June 19, sending the stock price down sharply and making some of today’s earnings release little more than a formality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are a handful of things in the earnings release and from the analyst call that bear a closer look, including more detail on the company’s ongoing struggle with sales at stores open more than one year, — called comps — what’s happening with China, — its biggest growth market — and more detail on the company’s plans to increase returns and lower costs going forward. Let’s dig into the latest release for more insight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>A Record Quarter, but Traffic Was Down and Expenses Are Up</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starbucks reported record third quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 11% from last year, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 and adjusted EPS of $0.62, up 30% and 13%, respectively, year over year. Comps increased 1% on a consolidated basis, a further slowing of growth from the 2% comps increase in both the first and second quarters of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A closer look at comps offers some reason for concern. In prior years, Starbucks was able to consistently grow comps at or above — in some cases well above — 3%, from a mix of higher traffic and bigger tickets. However, over the past year, traffic has been relatively flat, while bigger tickets have done all the heavy lifting. Unfortunately, it’s starting to look like Starbucks is developing a traffic problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a breakdown of comps by geographical segment last quarter:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:block {"ref":18} /--></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the table shows, Starbucks sold more goods — or higher-priced goods — to fewer customers in every market last quarter. But there is some additional context to consider. On the earnings call, Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said that a decline in Frappuccino sales and the May 29 anti-bias training closure took a three-point bite out of the Americas segment, though only about one-half point of that was due to the store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comps in China fell 2% in the quarter, a sharp turn negative after what had been steady positive growth. This weak result caused the CAP segment to report negative comps in the quarter, driven by a 3% decline in transactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Operating margins also declined in the quarter, falling from 18.4% last year to 16.5%. The company said the decline was a product of higher spending on store employees, the increased mix of food sales, and the impact of taking full ownership of the mainland China stores late last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially all of Starbucks’ operating income decline was related to its U.S. operations. Americas segment operating margin declined 2.9 percentage points to 21.5%, and operating income fell $66 million, while operating income increased in all of Starbucks’ other segments. Consolidated operating income declined $6 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the earnings call, CFO Scott Maw said that the increased expense in the quarter was a product of several things, including planned increased spending on employees, the impact of higher food mix, planned investments in technology, and the impact of the May 29 U.S. store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>
Blame It on Frappuccino and No Coffee Culture?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maw also said that management now expects its full-year comps to come in slightly below the low end of the company’s 3%-5% growth range, as its expectations are relatively muted for the fiscal fourth quarter. This is likely driven by continued unexpected weakness in sales of its blended Frappuccino beverages, which have declined 3% in 2018, after growing 17%, 5%, and 4% in the prior three fiscal years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, non-coffee beverages, including Teavana-branded teas, continue to perform well, as do sales of food. Teavana and refreshment beverages have increased at least 12% for four consecutive years, and were up 14% year-to-date through May 2018, while food has accounted for 22% of sales this year. On the earnings call, management said that it was seeing growth in every beverage segment, and food, with the exception of Frappuccino. Unfortunately, the positive results from its other products are not enough to offset weak Frappuccino sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management is clearly concerned about comps in China, but its bigger focus is on store expansion. The company aims to expand from 3,000 stores in 100 cities at recent count, to 6,000 stores in 230 cities by 2022. On the earnings call, China CEO Belinda Wong emphasized that China is still a developing coffee market, and that a big part of the company’s long-term success there will be tied to its ability to expand the market and continue introducing more and more people to coffee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the company moves closer to fiscal year-end, it continues to tweak its earnings guidance. Management revised guidance for GAAP earnings up from $3.23-$3.26 per share to $3.26-$3.28 per share, and tightened the non-GAAP range from $2.39-$2.43 per share to $2.40-$2.42 per share. And as discussed above, global comps are expected to be at the lower end of the 3%-5% range next quarter and below 3% for the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management also committed to taking steps in fiscal 2019 to drive better returns, including accelerating the closure of underperforming company-owned stores and focusing new expansion on its best markets, while opening fewer licensed stores in the U.S. China, on the other hand, is set to see an acceleration of new store expansion, with the company planning to increase its pace by 20% starting next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are legitimate challenges in front of Starbucks, including retail weakness in the U.S. and speed bumps in China as it aggressively develops that largely untapped market. But with a powerful brand and history of excellent operating results, I wouldn’t count the coffee giant out just yet. After all, sales and earnings — as we just saw — continue to grow, and its powerful economic model generates substantial cash flow that it’s increasingly returning to shareholders.</p>

Unfortunately, the positive results from its other products are not enough to offset weak Frappuccino sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management is clearly concerned about comps in China, but its bigger focus is on store expansion. The company aims to expand from 3,000 stores in 100 cities at recent count, to 6,000 stores in 230 cities by 2022. On the earnings call, China CEO Belinda Wong emphasized that China is still a developing coffee market, and that a big part of the company’s long-term success there will be tied to its ability to expand the market and continue introducing more and more people to coffee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the company moves closer to fiscal year-end, it continues to tweak its earnings guidance. Management revised guidance for GAAP earnings up from $3.23-$3.26 per share to $3.26-$3.28 per share, and tightened the non-GAAP range from $2.39-$2.43 per share to $2.40-$2.42 per share. And as discussed above, global comps are expected to be at the lower end of the 3%-5% range next quarter and below 3% for the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management also committed to taking steps in fiscal 2019 to drive better returns, including accelerating the closure of underperforming company-owned stores and focusing new expansion on its best markets, while opening fewer licensed stores in the U.S. China, on the other hand, is set to see an acceleration of new store expansion, with the company planning to increase its pace by 20% starting next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are legitimate challenges in front of Starbucks, including retail weakness in the U.S. and speed bumps in China as it aggressively develops that largely untapped market. But with a powerful brand and history of excellent operating results, I wouldn’t count the coffee giant out just yet. After all, sales and earnings — as we just saw — continue to grow, and its powerful economic model generates substantial cash flow that it’s increasingly returning to shareholders.</p>

<p>The outlook for<strong>&nbsp;Luckin Coffee</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/otc/luckin-coffee-inc/lknc.y/">OTC:LKNC.Y</a>)&nbsp;seems to be improving &nbsp;after the company announced a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/16/this-left-for-dead-stock-is-soaring-in-tuesdays-we/">restructuring plan</a>&nbsp;for it's financial obligations with some of its creditors that could help it climb out of bankruptcy. Let's dig deeper to find out what this deal could mean for equity investors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Details of the restructuring&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In February, Luckin Coffee&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/05/luckin-coffee-goes-bankrupt-with-chapter-15-filing/">filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy</a>&nbsp;protection, a section of the U.S bankruptcy code that deals with foreign companies. This move allows Luckin to shield its assets through negotiations with creditors while management works to keep the operational momentum going on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, the company is making impressive progress toward fulfilling its objectives.&nbsp;<img alt="A stock chart and a green upward moving stock arrow." src="https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F619017%2Fgettyimages-1215230330.jpg&amp;w=700&amp;op=resize" srcset="https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A//g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/619017/gettyimages-1215230330.jpg&amp;w=300&amp;op=resize 300w, https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A//g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/619017/gettyimages-1215230330.jpg&amp;w=1000&amp;op=resize 1000w, https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A//g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/619017/gettyimages-1215230330.jpg&amp;w=2000&amp;op=resize 2000w"></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On March 16, Luckin announced an agreement with key creditors to restructure 59% of its $460 million in convertible notes due 2025. These bondholders will recover roughly 91% to 96% of par value through cash, new debt, and Luckin Coffee shares.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Luckin's press release, cash recovery will represent 32% of par value, or principal amount of the debt, which could be around $87 million in total. The debt is in the form of one-year notes (23% of par) and five-year notes (30% of par). Both pay interest rates of 9%.&nbsp;But the one-year notes will give bondholders the option to convert a portion of their value for shares in the event of a future capital raise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What does this mean for stockholders?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luckin's restructuring plan looks like good news for shareholders. If it is approved, the deal could significantly reduce Luckin's debt and the possibility of insolvency -- especially if coupled with management's plans to raise at least $250 million in new equity funding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The downside is dilution, which reduces shareholders' claims on future earnings.&nbsp;But Luckin may not need to raise additional capital. Recent filings suggest the company's balance sheet is already in good shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Luckin's liquidator's report in the Cayman Islands, the company boasts $743 million in cash and equivalents as of November 2020, which is significantly more than its total debt of $460 million. Fines, such as the recent $180 million penalty to settle fraud charges with the SEC, could hurt liquidity. But management expects to be cash-flow positive by the first half of 2023, so there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Is the stock a buy?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luckin Coffee is turning itself around by closing underperforming stores, strengthening its store-opening criteria, and optimizing cost control. It is also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/growth-stocks/">rapidly growing</a>, with net revenue growing 18%, 50%, and 36%, on a year over year basis, for the first three quarters of 2020, respectively. The series of quarterly revenue growth is further evidence that management is working to put the past behind it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But while I'm cautiously optimistic about Luckin's future, the stock is still risky. The new agreement must be approved by the Cayman court and enforced in the United States before it can go into effect. And high levels of equity dilution could also be a problem for equity holders. However, should Luckin mange to come out of bankruptcy on favorable terms, it should act as a huge tailwind for its stock.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This article represents the opinion of the writer, who may disagree with the “official” recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service. We’re motley! Questioning an investing thesis -- even one of our own -- helps us all think critically about investing and make decisions that help us become smarter, happier, and richer.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every investor would love to stumble upon the perfect stock. But will you ever really find a stock that provides&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;you could possibly want?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One thing's for sure: You'll never discover truly great investments unless you actively look for them. Let's discuss the ideal qualities of a perfect stock, then decide if&nbsp;<strong>Coffee Holding</strong>&nbsp;(Nasdaq: JVA)&nbsp;fits the bill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The quest for perfection<br></strong>Stocks that look great based on one factor may prove horrible elsewhere, making due diligence a crucial part of your investing research. The best stocks excel in many different areas, including these important factors:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Growth.</strong>&nbsp;Expanding businesses show healthy revenue growth. While past growth is no guarantee that revenue will keep rising, it's certainly a better sign than a stagnant top line.</li><li><strong>Margins.</strong>&nbsp;Higher sales mean nothing if a company can't produce profits from them. Strong margins ensure that company can turn revenue into profit.</li><li><strong>Balance sheet.</strong>&nbsp;At debt-laden companies, banks and bondholders compete with shareholders for management's attention. Companies with strong balance sheets don't have to worry about the distraction of debt.</li><li><strong>Money-making opportunities.</strong>&nbsp;Return on equity helps measure how well a company is finding opportunities to turn its resources into profitable business endeavors.</li><li><strong>Valuation.</strong>&nbsp;You can't afford to pay too much for even the best companies. By using normalized figures, you can see how a stock's simple earnings multiple fits into a longer-term context.</li><li><strong>Dividends.</strong>&nbsp;For tangible proof of profits, a check to shareholders every three months can't be beat. Companies with solid dividends and strong commitments to increasing payouts treat shareholders well.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With those factors in mind, let's take a closer look at Coffee Holding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table {"className":"is-style-stripes"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><th><strong>Factor</strong></th><th><strong>What We Want to See</strong></th><th><strong>Actual</strong></th><th><strong>Pass or Fail?</strong></th></tr><tr><td>Growth</td><td>5-Year Annual Revenue Growth &gt; 15%</td><td>28%</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>1-Year Revenue Growth &gt; 12%</td><td>52.7%</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>Margins</td><td>Gross Margin &gt; 35%</td><td>5.1%</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Net Margin &gt; 15%</td><td>0.5%</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>Balance Sheet</td><td>Debt to Equity &lt; 50%</td><td>5.8%</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Current Ratio &gt; 1.3</td><td>3.50</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>Opportunities</td><td>Return on Equity &gt; 15%</td><td>4.8%</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>Valuation</td><td>Normalized P/E &lt; 20</td><td>52.83</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>Dividends</td><td>Current Yield &gt; 2%</td><td>1.7%</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>5-Year Dividend Growth &gt; 10%</td><td>0%*</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Total Score</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>4 out of 10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Source: S&amp;P Capital IQ. Total score = number of passes. *Since initiating a regular dividend in July 2010.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With four points, Coffee Holding could use a little pick-me-up. The stock has also gotten cold and bitter, with about a 20% drop in the past year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coffee Holding is benefiting from the current craze in the coffee industry. As a wholesale roasting company for both branded and private-label coffee,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2012/03/15/1-reason-this-coffee-stocked-surged-75-in-5-days.aspx">Coffee Holding does a huge amount of business</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>Green Mountain Coffee Roasters</strong>&nbsp;(Nasdaq: GMCR). That was a good thing when Green Mountain was on top of its game, but recently, it's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2012/06/18/3-earnings-reports-that-caught-my-attention-last-.aspx">raised some big uncertainties</a>&nbsp;that have fallen through to Coffee Holding's bottom line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with&nbsp;<strong>Peet's Coffee &amp; Tea</strong>&nbsp;(Nasdaq: PEET)&nbsp;having agreed to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2012/07/23/coffee-stocks-are-hot-again.aspx">billion-dollar buyout from a private equity firm</a>&nbsp;in July, interest in the space has stayed extremely high. For small players like Coffee Holding and&nbsp;<strong>Caribou Coffee</strong>&nbsp;(Nasdaq: CBOU), the prospect of a buyout looms large, and it explains much of Coffee Holdings' high valuation based on trailing earnings.</p>

<p>The big question, though, is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2012/07/14/3-reasons-to-buy-coffee-holding-company.aspx">whether forward earnings estimates are accurate</a>. The consensus calls for earnings of more than $1 per share in fiscal 2013, giving Coffee Holding a forward P/E of less than 7. With&nbsp;<strong>Starbucks</strong>&nbsp;(Nasdaq: SBUX)&nbsp;having introduced its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2012/09/24/this-starbucks-shot-wont-kill-green-mountain.aspx">Verismo single-serve coffee machine</a>&nbsp;and Green Mountain facing rising inventory, that outlook may be overly optimistic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Coffee Holding to improve, it simply needs to keep on its growth trajectory and let rising earnings catch up with the stock. It's a long way from perfection, but Coffee Holding could give your portfolio a big jolt if things work out well.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expectations were pretty muted for Starbucks [stock display="(NASDAQ:SBUX)" symbol="SBUX" type="bar" ] heading into its fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings report, released on July 26 after market close. This was in large part because the company already let the cat out of the bag, pre-reporting a handful of metrics on June 19, sending the stock price down sharply and making some of today’s earnings release little more than a formality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are a handful of things in the earnings release and from the analyst call that bear a closer look, including more detail on the company’s ongoing struggle with sales at stores open more than one year, — called comps — what’s happening with China, — its biggest growth market — and more detail on the company’s plans to increase returns and lower costs going forward. Let’s dig into the latest release for more insight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>A Record Quarter, but Traffic Was Down and Expenses Are Up</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starbucks reported record third quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 11% from last year, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 and adjusted EPS of $0.62, up 30% and 13%, respectively, year over year. Comps increased 1% on a consolidated basis, a further slowing of growth from the 2% comps increase in both the first and second quarters of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A closer look at comps offers some reason for concern. In prior years, Starbucks was able to consistently grow comps at or above — in some cases well above — 3%, from a mix of higher traffic and bigger tickets. However, over the past year, traffic has been relatively flat, while bigger tickets have done all the heavy lifting. Unfortunately, it’s starting to look like Starbucks is developing a traffic problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a breakdown of comps by geographical segment last quarter:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:block {"ref":18} /--></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the table shows, Starbucks sold more goods — or higher-priced goods — to fewer customers in every market last quarter. But there is some additional context to consider. On the earnings call, Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said that a decline in Frappuccino sales and the May 29 anti-bias training closure took a three-point bite out of the Americas segment, though only about one-half point of that was due to the store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comps in China fell 2% in the quarter, a sharp turn negative after what had been steady positive growth. This weak result caused the CAP segment to report negative comps in the quarter, driven by a 3% decline in transactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Operating margins also declined in the quarter, falling from 18.4% last year to 16.5%. The company said the decline was a product of higher spending on store employees, the increased mix of food sales, and the impact of taking full ownership of the mainland China stores late last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially all of Starbucks’ operating income decline was related to its U.S. operations. Americas segment operating margin declined 2.9 percentage points to 21.5%, and operating income fell $66 million, while operating income increased in all of Starbucks’ other segments. Consolidated operating income declined $6 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the earnings call, CFO Scott Maw said that the increased expense in the quarter was a product of several things, including planned increased spending on employees, the impact of higher food mix, planned investments in technology, and the impact of the May 29 U.S. store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>
Blame It on Frappuccino and No Coffee Culture?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maw also said that management now expects its full-year comps to come in slightly below the low end of the company’s 3%-5% growth range, as its expectations are relatively muted for the fiscal fourth quarter. This is likely driven by continued unexpected weakness in sales of its blended Frappuccino beverages, which have declined 3% in 2018, after growing 17%, 5%, and 4% in the prior three fiscal years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, non-coffee beverages, including Teavana-branded teas, continue to perform well, as do sales of food. Teavana and refreshment beverages have increased at least 12% for four consecutive years, and were up 14% year-to-date through May 2018, while food has accounted for 22% of sales this year. On the earnings call, management said that it was seeing growth in every beverage segment, and food, with the exception of Frappuccino. Unfortunately, the positive results from its other products are not enough to offset weak Frappuccino sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management is clearly concerned about comps in China, but its bigger focus is on store expansion. The company aims to expand from 3,000 stores in 100 cities at recent count, to 6,000 stores in 230 cities by 2022. On the earnings call, China CEO Belinda Wong emphasized that China is still a developing coffee market, and that a big part of the company’s long-term success there will be tied to its ability to expand the market and continue introducing more and more people to coffee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the company moves closer to fiscal year-end, it continues to tweak its earnings guidance. Management revised guidance for GAAP earnings up from $3.23-$3.26 per share to $3.26-$3.28 per share, and tightened the non-GAAP range from $2.39-$2.43 per share to $2.40-$2.42 per share. And as discussed above, global comps are expected to be at the lower end of the 3%-5% range next quarter and below 3% for the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management also committed to taking steps in fiscal 2019 to drive better returns, including accelerating the closure of underperforming company-owned stores and focusing new expansion on its best markets, while opening fewer licensed stores in the U.S. China, on the other hand, is set to see an acceleration of new store expansion, with the company planning to increase its pace by 20% starting next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are legitimate challenges in front of Starbucks, including retail weakness in the U.S. and speed bumps in China as it aggressively develops that largely untapped market. But with a powerful brand and history of excellent operating results, I wouldn’t count the coffee giant out just yet. After all, sales and earnings — as we just saw — continue to grow, and its powerful economic model generates substantial cash flow that it’s increasingly returning to shareholders.</p>

<p>Expectations were pretty muted for Starbucks [stock display="(NASDAQ:SBUX)" symbol="SBUX" type="bar" ] heading into its fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings report, released on July 26 after market close. This was in large part because the company already let the cat out of the bag, pre-reporting a handful of metrics on June 19, sending the stock price down sharply and making some of today’s earnings release little more than a formality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are a handful of things in the earnings release and from the analyst call that bear a closer look, including more detail on the company’s ongoing struggle with sales at stores open more than one year, — called comps — what’s happening with China, — its biggest growth market — and more detail on the company’s plans to increase returns and lower costs going forward. Let’s dig into the latest release for more insight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>A Record Quarter, but Traffic Was Down and Expenses Are Up</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starbucks reported record third quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 11% from last year, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 and adjusted EPS of $0.62, up 30% and 13%, respectively, year over year. Comps increased 1% on a consolidated basis, a further slowing of growth from the 2% comps increase in both the first and second quarters of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A closer look at comps offers some reason for concern. In prior years, Starbucks was able to consistently grow comps at or above — in some cases well above — 3%, from a mix of higher traffic and bigger tickets. However, over the past year, traffic has been relatively flat, while bigger tickets have done all the heavy lifting. Unfortunately, it’s starting to look like Starbucks is developing a traffic problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a breakdown of comps by geographical segment last quarter:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:block {"ref":18} /--></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the table shows, Starbucks sold more goods — or higher-priced goods — to fewer customers in every market last quarter. But there is some additional context to consider. On the earnings call, Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said that a decline in Frappuccino sales and the May 29 anti-bias training closure took a three-point bite out of the Americas segment, though only about one-half point of that was due to the store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comps in China fell 2% in the quarter, a sharp turn negative after what had been steady positive growth. This weak result caused the CAP segment to report negative comps in the quarter, driven by a 3% decline in transactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Operating margins also declined in the quarter, falling from 18.4% last year to 16.5%. The company said the decline was a product of higher spending on store employees, the increased mix of food sales, and the impact of taking full ownership of the mainland China stores late last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially all of Starbucks’ operating income decline was related to its U.S. operations. Americas segment operating margin declined 2.9 percentage points to 21.5%, and operating income fell $66 million, while operating income increased in all of Starbucks’ other segments. Consolidated operating income declined $6 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the earnings call, CFO Scott Maw said that the increased expense in the quarter was a product of several things, including planned increased spending on employees, the impact of higher food mix, planned investments in technology, and the impact of the May 29 U.S. store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>
Blame It on Frappuccino and No Coffee Culture?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maw also said that management now expects its full-year comps to come in slightly below the low end of the company’s 3%-5% growth range, as its expectations are relatively muted for the fiscal fourth quarter. This is likely driven by continued unexpected weakness in sales of its blended Frappuccino beverages, which have declined 3% in 2018, after growing 17%, 5%, and 4% in the prior three fiscal years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, non-coffee beverages, including Teavana-branded teas, continue to perform well, as do sales of food. Teavana and refreshment beverages have increased at least 12% for four consecutive years, and were up 14% year-to-date through May 2018, while food has accounted for 22% of sales this year. On the earnings call, management said that it was seeing growth in every beverage segment, and food, with the exception of Frappuccino. Unfortunately, the positive results from its other products are not enough to offset weak Frappuccino sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management is clearly concerned about comps in China, but its bigger focus is on store expansion. The company aims to expand from 3,000 stores in 100 cities at recent count, to 6,000 stores in 230 cities by 2022. On the earnings call, China CEO Belinda Wong emphasized that China is still a developing coffee market, and that a big part of the company’s long-term success there will be tied to its ability to expand the market and continue introducing more and more people to coffee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the company moves closer to fiscal year-end, it continues to tweak its earnings guidance. Management revised guidance for GAAP earnings up from $3.23-$3.26 per share to $3.26-$3.28 per share, and tightened the non-GAAP range from $2.39-$2.43 per share to $2.40-$2.42 per share. And as discussed above, global comps are expected to be at the lower end of the 3%-5% range next quarter and below 3% for the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management also committed to taking steps in fiscal 2019 to drive better returns, including accelerating the closure of underperforming company-owned stores and focusing new expansion on its best markets, while opening fewer licensed stores in the U.S. China, on the other hand, is set to see an acceleration of new store expansion, with the company planning to increase its pace by 20% starting next year.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The outlook for<strong>&nbsp;Luckin Coffee</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/otc/luckin-coffee-inc/lknc.y/">OTC:LKNC.Y</a>)&nbsp;seems to be improving &nbsp;after the company announced a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/16/this-left-for-dead-stock-is-soaring-in-tuesdays-we/">restructuring plan</a>&nbsp;for it's financial obligations with some of its creditors that could help it climb out of bankruptcy. Let's dig deeper to find out what this deal could mean for equity investors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Details of the restructuring&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In February, Luckin Coffee&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/05/luckin-coffee-goes-bankrupt-with-chapter-15-filing/">filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy</a>&nbsp;protection, a section of the U.S bankruptcy code that deals with foreign companies. This move allows Luckin to shield its assets through negotiations with creditors while management works to keep the operational momentum going on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, the company is making impressive progress toward fulfilling its objectives.&nbsp;<img alt="A stock chart and a green upward moving stock arrow." src="https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F619017%2Fgettyimages-1215230330.jpg&amp;w=700&amp;op=resize" srcset="https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A//g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/619017/gettyimages-1215230330.jpg&amp;w=300&amp;op=resize 300w, https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A//g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/619017/gettyimages-1215230330.jpg&amp;w=1000&amp;op=resize 1000w, https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A//g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/619017/gettyimages-1215230330.jpg&amp;w=2000&amp;op=resize 2000w"></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On March 16, Luckin announced an agreement with key creditors to restructure 59% of its $460 million in convertible notes due 2025. These bondholders will recover roughly 91% to 96% of par value through cash, new debt, and Luckin Coffee shares.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Luckin's press release, cash recovery will represent 32% of par value, or principal amount of the debt, which could be around $87 million in total. The debt is in the form of one-year notes (23% of par) and five-year notes (30% of par). Both pay interest rates of 9%.&nbsp;But the one-year notes will give bondholders the option to convert a portion of their value for shares in the event of a future capital raise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What does this mean for stockholders?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luckin's restructuring plan looks like good news for shareholders. If it is approved, the deal could significantly reduce Luckin's debt and the possibility of insolvency -- especially if coupled with management's plans to raise at least $250 million in new equity funding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The downside is dilution, which reduces shareholders' claims on future earnings.&nbsp;But Luckin may not need to raise additional capital. Recent filings suggest the company's balance sheet is already in good shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Luckin's liquidator's report in the Cayman Islands, the company boasts $743 million in cash and equivalents as of November 2020, which is significantly more than its total debt of $460 million. Fines, such as the recent $180 million penalty to settle fraud charges with the SEC, could hurt liquidity. But management expects to be cash-flow positive by the first half of 2023, so there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Is the stock a buy?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luckin Coffee is turning itself around by closing underperforming stores, strengthening its store-opening criteria, and optimizing cost control. It is also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/growth-stocks/">rapidly growing</a>, with net revenue growing 18%, 50%, and 36%, on a year over year basis, for the first three quarters of 2020, respectively. The series of quarterly revenue growth is further evidence that management is working to put the past behind it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But while I'm cautiously optimistic about Luckin's future, the stock is still risky. The new agreement must be approved by the Cayman court and enforced in the United States before it can go into effect. And high levels of equity dilution could also be a problem for equity holders. However, should Luckin mange to come out of bankruptcy on favorable terms, it should act as a huge tailwind for its stock.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This article represents the opinion of the writer, who may disagree with the “official” recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service. We’re motley! Questioning an investing thesis -- even one of our own -- helps us all think critically about investing and make decisions that help us become smarter, happier, and richer.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A closer look at comps offers some reason for concern. In prior years, Starbucks was able to consistently grow comps at or above — in some cases well above — 3%, from a mix of higher traffic and bigger tickets. However, over the past year, traffic has been relatively flat, while bigger tickets have done all the heavy lifting. Unfortunately, it’s starting to look like Starbucks is developing a traffic problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a breakdown of comps by geographical segment last quarter:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:block {"ref":18} /--></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the table shows, Starbucks sold more goods — or higher-priced goods — to fewer customers in every market last quarter. But there is some additional context to consider. On the earnings call, Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said that a decline in Frappuccino sales and the May 29 anti-bias training closure took a three-point bite out of the Americas segment, though only about one-half point of that was due to the store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comps in China fell 2% in the quarter, a sharp turn negative after what had been steady positive growth. This weak result caused the CAP segment to report negative comps in the quarter, driven by a 3% decline in transactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Operating margins also declined in the quarter, falling from 18.4% last year to 16.5%. The company said the decline was a product of higher spending on store employees, the increased mix of food sales, and the impact of taking full ownership of the mainland China stores late last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially all of Starbucks’ operating income decline was related to its U.S. operations. Americas segment operating margin declined 2.9 percentage points to 21.5%, and operating income fell $66 million, while operating income increased in all of Starbucks’ other segments. Consolidated operating income declined $6 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the earnings call, CFO Scott Maw said that the increased expense in the quarter was a product of several things, including planned increased spending on employees, the impact of higher food mix, planned investments in technology, and the impact of the May 29 U.S. store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>
Blame It on Frappuccino and No Coffee Culture?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maw also said that management now expects its full-year comps to come in slightly below the low end of the company’s 3%-5% growth range, as its expectations are relatively muted for the fiscal fourth quarter. This is likely driven by continued unexpected weakness in sales of its blended Frappuccino beverages, which have declined 3% in 2018, after growing 17%, 5%, and 4% in the prior three fiscal years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, non-coffee beverages, including Teavana-branded teas, continue to perform well, as do sales of food. Teavana and refreshment beverages have increased at least 12% for four consecutive years, and were up 14% year-to-date through May 2018, while food has accounted for 22% of sales this year. On the earnings call, management said that it was seeing growth in every beverage segment, and food, with the exception of Frappuccino. Unfortunately, the positive results from its other products are not enough to offset weak Frappuccino sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management is clearly concerned about comps in China, but its bigger focus is on store expansion. The company aims to expand from 3,000 stores in 100 cities at recent count, to 6,000 stores in 230 cities by 2022. On the earnings call, China CEO Belinda Wong emphasized that China is still a developing coffee market, and that a big part of the company’s long-term success there will be tied to its ability to expand the market and continue introducing more and more people to coffee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the company moves closer to fiscal year-end, it continues to tweak its earnings guidance. Management revised guidance for GAAP earnings up from $3.23-$3.26 per share to $3.26-$3.28 per share, and tightened the non-GAAP range from $2.39-$2.43 per share to $2.40-$2.42 per share. And as discussed above, global comps are expected to be at the lower end of the 3%-5% range next quarter and below 3% for the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management also committed to taking steps in fiscal 2019 to drive better returns, including accelerating the closure of underperforming company-owned stores and focusing new expansion on its best markets, while opening fewer licensed stores in the U.S. China, on the other hand, is set to see an acceleration of new store expansion, with the company planning to increase its pace by 20% starting next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are legitimate challenges in front of Starbucks, including retail weakness in the U.S. and speed bumps in China as it aggressively develops that largely untapped market. But with a powerful brand and history of excellent operating results, I wouldn’t count the coffee giant out just yet. After all, sales and earnings — as we just saw — continue to grow, and its powerful economic model generates substantial cash flow that it’s increasingly returning to shareholders.</p>

<p>Expectations were pretty muted for Starbucks [stock display="(NASDAQ:SBUX)" symbol="SBUX" type="bar" ] heading into its fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings report, released on July 26 after market close. This was in large part because the company already let the cat out of the bag, pre-reporting a handful of metrics on June 19, sending the stock price down sharply and making some of today’s earnings release little more than a formality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are a handful of things in the earnings release and from the analyst call that bear a closer look, including more detail on the company’s ongoing struggle with sales at stores open more than one year, — called comps — what’s happening with China, — its biggest growth market — and more detail on the company’s plans to increase returns and lower costs going forward. Let’s dig into the latest release for more insight.</p>

<h2>A Record Quarter, but Traffic Was Down and Expenses Are Up</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starbucks reported record third quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 11% from last year, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 and adjusted EPS of $0.62, up 30% and 13%, respectively, year over year.

Americas segment operating margin declined 2.9 percentage points to 21.5%, and operating income fell $66 million, while operating income increased in all of Starbucks’ other segments. Consolidated operating income declined $6 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the earnings call, CFO Scott Maw said that the increased expense in the quarter was a product of several things, including planned increased spending on employees, the impact of higher food mix, planned investments in technology, and the impact of the May 29 U.S. store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>
Blame It on Frappuccino and No Coffee Culture?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maw also said that management now expects its full-year comps to come in slightly below the low end of the company’s 3%-5% growth range, as its expectations are relatively muted for the fiscal fourth quarter. This is likely driven by continued unexpected weakness in sales of its blended Frappuccino beverages, which have declined 3% in 2018, after growing 17%, 5%, and 4% in the prior three fiscal years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, non-coffee beverages, including Teavana-branded teas, continue to perform well, as do sales of food. Teavana and refreshment beverages have increased at least 12% for four consecutive years, and were up 14% year-to-date through May 2018, while food has accounted for 22% of sales this year. On the earnings call, management said that it was seeing growth in every beverage segment, and food, with the exception of Frappuccino. Unfortunately, the positive results from its other products are not enough to offset weak Frappuccino sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management is clearly concerned about comps in China, but its bigger focus is on store expansion. The company aims to expand from 3,000 stores in 100 cities at recent count, to 6,000 stores in 230 cities by 2022. On the earnings call, China CEO Belinda Wong emphasized that China is still a developing coffee market, and that a big part of the company’s long-term success there will be tied to its ability to expand the market and continue introducing more and more people to coffee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the company moves closer to fiscal year-end, it continues to tweak its earnings guidance. Management revised guidance for GAAP earnings up from $3.23-$3.26 per share to $3.26-$3.28 per share, and tightened the non-GAAP range from $2.39-$2.43 per share to $2.40-$2.42 per share. And as discussed above, global comps are expected to be at the lower end of the 3%-5% range next quarter and below 3% for the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management also committed to taking steps in fiscal 2019 to drive better returns, including accelerating the closure of underperforming company-owned stores and focusing new expansion on its best markets, while opening fewer licensed stores in the U.S. China, on the other hand, is set to see an acceleration of new store expansion, with the company planning to increase its pace by 20% starting next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are legitimate challenges in front of Starbucks, including retail weakness in the U.S. and speed bumps in China as it aggressively develops that largely untapped market. But with a powerful brand and history of excellent operating results, I wouldn’t count the coffee giant out just yet. After all, sales and earnings — as we just saw — continue to grow, and its powerful economic model generates substantial cash flow that it’s increasingly returning to shareholders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expectations were pretty muted for Starbucks [stock display="(NASDAQ:SBUX)" symbol="SBUX" type="bar" ] heading into its fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings report, released on July 26 after market close. This was in large part because the company already let the cat out of the bag, pre-reporting a handful of metrics on June 19, sending the stock price down sharply and making some of today’s earnings release little more than a formality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are a handful of things in the earnings release and from the analyst call that bear a closer look, including more detail on the company’s ongoing struggle with sales at stores open more than one year, — called comps — what’s happening with China, — its biggest growth market — and more detail on the company’s plans to increase returns and lower costs going forward. Let’s dig into the latest release for more insight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>A Record Quarter, but Traffic Was Down and Expenses Are Up</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starbucks reported record third quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 11% from last year, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 and adjusted EPS of $0.62, up 30% and 13%, respectively, year over year. Comps increased 1% on a consolidated basis, a further slowing of growth from the 2% comps increase in both the first and second quarters of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A closer look at comps offers some reason for concern. In prior years, Starbucks was able to consistently grow comps at or above — in some cases well above — 3%, from a mix of higher traffic and bigger tickets. However, over the past year, traffic has been relatively flat, while bigger tickets have done all the heavy lifting. Unfortunately, it’s starting to look like Starbucks is developing a traffic problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a breakdown of comps by geographical segment last quarter:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:block {"ref":18} /--></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the table shows, Starbucks sold more goods — or higher-priced goods — to fewer customers in every market last quarter. But there is some additional context to consider. On the earnings call, Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said that a decline in Frappuccino sales and the May 29 anti-bias training closure took a three-point bite out of the Americas segment, though only about one-half point of that was due to the store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comps in China fell 2% in the quarter, a sharp turn negative after what had been steady positive growth. This weak result caused the CAP segment to report negative comps in the quarter, driven by a 3% decline in transactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Operating margins also declined in the quarter, falling from 18.4% last year to 16.5%. The company said the decline was a product of higher spending on store employees, the increased mix of food sales, and the impact of taking full ownership of the mainland China stores late last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially all of Starbucks’ operating income decline was related to its U.S. operations. Americas segment operating margin declined 2.9 percentage points to 21.5%, and operating income fell $66 million, while operating income increased in all of Starbucks’ other segments. Consolidated operating income declined $6 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Welcome to my technical project for The Motley Fool. The following is a brief summation of the functions demonstrated through the project. I attempted to solve each of the requirements by creating  different elements to demonstrate different knowledges and skill sets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> The elements used are broken up as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Custom Plugin "StockFool"</li><li>3 Custom Gutenberg Blocks<ul><li>Author Information Block</li><li>Recommendations listing Block</li><li>News listings w/ pagination Block</li></ul></li><li>Child-Theme for TwentyTwentOne</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="StockFool">StockFool</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>StockFool is a plugin build to complete the API call portion of the project requirements. Based on its usage it will either populate an action bar at the bottom of the page or display. I used the native Wordpress <meta charset="utf-8">shortcode function to build this. I also implemented an OOP based settings class within the plugin files, however it is only used to store the API key for Financial Modeling Prep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To active the shortcode use the following formate:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>[[stockdisplay="Sample Text"  type="bar|box"  symbol="SBUX"]]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are three elements that are grabbed and passed into JS via "wp_localize_script" and "wp_enqueue_script".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>"display" is whatever text/content you would like displayed inline of wherever the shortcode is called. Whatever is in the <br>"display" field will be displayed in highlighted yellow.</li><li>"type" can be defined as either "box" or "bar".  If set to "bar", upon mouse over a information bar containing company information will be displayed until the mouseout event triggers.</li><li>"symbol" insert whatever stock symbol you will to retrieve data on.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A demo of the "bar" feature can be found here, on the <a href="https://iowhy.com/news/starbucks-reports-record-quarter-but-challenges-remain/" data-type="news" data-id="178">Stock Recommendation article</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A demo of the "box" feature can be found here, on the <a href="https://iowhy.com/starbucks/" data-type="page" data-id="165">Company Page Requirement page.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's currently limited to one call per page, but could easily be expanded to handle multiple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="blocks">Custom Gutenburg Blocks</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I decided to demonstrate my knowledge of one of the newer WordPress features, content blocks for the Gutenburg editor. These are usable on any post type where the <meta charset="utf-8">Gutenburg editor is enabled. They are essentially customizable widgets, very versatile, very locked down. I use these all the time for adding in advanced features without requiring significant technical knowhow for on the page editors side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are three blocks added in total, all of which are built and initialized within the child-theme for TwentyTwentyOne.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Author block</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drag anywhere on the page to display author's name and post publish date. Author is defined by selecting a user. Can be expanded to use any data from the user table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><meta charset="utf-8">A demo of the "Author Block" can be found here, on the <a href="https://iowhy.com/starbucks/" data-type="page" data-id="165"><meta charset="utf-8"> </a><a href="https://iowhy.com/news/starbucks-reports-record-quarter-but-challenges-remain/" data-type="news" data-id="178">Stock Recommendation article</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 id="recommendations">Recommendations Listing <meta charset="utf-8">Block</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drag this block anywhere on the page to display a selection of manually set article listings. Once the block is placed, the use can select from any of the "recommendations" post type articles to display them. User can also define what the heading of the block will be displayed as.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><meta charset="utf-8">A demo of the "Recommendations Listing <meta charset="utf-8">Block" can be found here, on the <a href="https://iowhy.com/starbucks/" data-type="page" data-id="165"><meta charset="utf-8"><meta charset="utf-8"></a><a href="https://iowhy.com/starbucks/" data-type="page" data-id="165">Company Page Requirement page.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 id="news">News Listing w/ Pagination <meta charset="utf-8">Block</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This functions similarly to the "Recommendations Listing <meta charset="utf-8">Block", but adds in pagination limited to 10 posts per page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><meta charset="utf-8">A demo of the "News Listing w/ Pagination <meta charset="utf-8">Block" can be found here, on the <a href="https://iowhy.com/starbucks/" data-type="page" data-id="165"><meta charset="utf-8"><meta charset="utf-8">Company Page Requirement page.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="theme">Child-Theme for TwentyTwentyOne</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I created a child-theme for the default Wordpress theme TwentyTwentOne that is used in the project. The theme includes the following functions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Archive Template for the "Stock Recommendations" post type.</li><li>Functions.php where all of the block information is called.</li><li>Template parts for each block</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Archive Template</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is used to meet the requirement of "Create a Stock Recommendation archive page". It displays the archive posts' title, (exchange:symbol), and a brief excerpt. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://iowhy.com/recommendations/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://iowhy.com/recommendations/">This can be found here.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Functions.php</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here you can see all of the functions that hook the new blocks into WP as well as enqueue some styles and scripts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Template Parts</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>in the /template-parts/blocks/ directory you will find the templates that are used whenever one of the new blocks are called. They are very quick to modify due to their templated nature. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Additional Information</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I used ACF Pro in this project to attach fields to post types, taxonomies, and blocks. I used my personal pro license key for this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I used CPTUI for creating custom post types and custom taxonomies. I've used this plugin for years and it is highly effective for managing custom elements. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Custom Taxonomy</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I created a custom taxonomy called Associated Stock / 'stock_index'. It has two additional fields added to it via ACF for Exchange and Symbol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Create a News article</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several News articles created, mostly to fill out the 10+ pagination requirement. All news posts contain the "Author Info Block" that displays the author's info as well as the article publication date. There is also a side field for adding an associated stock to the article that is saved to the "stock_index" taxonomy. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> <a href="https://iowhy.com/news/starbucks-reports-record-quarter-but-challenges-remain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can see this requirement here.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Create a Stock Recommendation article</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For this I created 'recommendations' are a custom post type. It functions similarly to the standard 'post', but has the ability to attach an associated stock. It also has access to the 'author info block' to meet the author requirements of the project. This is also where you can find the StockFool company information bar on display. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This ajax grabs and displays all the required fields of the project:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Company Logo</li><li>Company Name</li><li>Exchange</li><li>Description</li><li>Industry</li><li>Sector</li><li>CEO</li><li>Website URL</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, it is currently limited to one per page, but could easily be adapted to multiple listings. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://iowhy.com/recommendations/buy-starbucks/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://iowhy.com/recommendations/buy-starbucks/" target="_blank">Yo</a><a href="https://iowhy.com/recommendations/buy-starbucks/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://iowhy.com/recommendations/buy-starbucks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">u</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://iowhy.com/recommendations/buy-starbucks/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://iowhy.com/recommendations/buy-starbucks/" target="_blank"> can see this requirement here.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Create a Stock Recommendation archive page</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This used a custom archive template that is stored within the child-theme. Relatively basic, displays stock recommendations are defined by the project requirements. I used the standard WordPress pagination function.<meta charset="utf-8"> It displays the archive posts' title, (exchange:symbol), and a brief excerpt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><meta charset="utf-8"><a href="https://iowhy.com/recommendations/" data-type="URL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can see this requirement here.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Create a Company Page</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I created this page within the base WordPress Pages. It contains all of the listed requirements for the page and uses several custom elements. This page contains the "box" version of the <a href="#StockFool" data-type="internal" data-id="#StockFool">StockFool</a> short code Plugin. It also contains the <meta charset="utf-8"><a href="#blocks" data-type="internal" data-id="#blocks">Custom Gutenburg Blocks</a> <a href="#recommendations" data-type="internal" data-id="#recommendations">"Recommendations Listings Block</a>" and "<meta charset="utf-8"><a href="#news" data-type="internal" data-id="#news">News Listing w/ Pagination <meta charset="utf-8">Block</a>". You can learn more about those features by clicking on any of the above mentioned links.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://iowhy.com/starbucks/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://iowhy.com/starbucks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can see this requirement here.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>I hope you enjoyed my work and look forward to hearing for you!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expectations were pretty muted for Starbucks [stock display="(NASDAQ:SBUX)" symbol="SBUX" type="bar" ] heading into its fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings report, released on July 26 after market close. This was in large part because the company already let the cat out of the bag, pre-reporting a handful of metrics on June 19, sending the stock price down sharply and making some of today’s earnings release little more than a formality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are a handful of things in the earnings release and from the analyst call that bear a closer look, including more detail on the company’s ongoing struggle with sales at stores open more than one year, — called comps — what’s happening with China, — its biggest growth market — and more detail on the company’s plans to increase returns and lower costs going forward. Let’s dig into the latest release for more insight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>A Record Quarter, but Traffic Was Down and Expenses Are Up</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starbucks reported record third quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 11% from last year, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 and adjusted EPS of $0.62, up 30% and 13%, respectively, year over year. Comps increased 1% on a consolidated basis, a further slowing of growth from the 2% comps increase in both the first and second quarters of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A closer look at comps offers some reason for concern. In prior years, Starbucks was able to consistently grow comps at or above — in some cases well above — 3%, from a mix of higher traffic and bigger tickets. However, over the past year, traffic has been relatively flat, while bigger tickets have done all the heavy lifting. Unfortunately, it’s starting to look like Starbucks is developing a traffic problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a breakdown of comps by geographical segment last quarter:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:block {"ref":18} /--></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the table shows, Starbucks sold more goods — or higher-priced goods — to fewer customers in every market last quarter. But there is some additional context to consider. On the earnings call, Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said that a decline in Frappuccino sales and the May 29 anti-bias training closure took a three-point bite out of the Americas segment, though only about one-half point of that was due to the store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comps in China fell 2% in the quarter, a sharp turn negative after what had been steady positive growth. This weak result caused the CAP segment to report negative comps in the quarter, driven by a 3% decline in transactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Operating margins also declined in the quarter, falling from 18.4% last year to 16.5%. The company said the decline was a product of higher spending on store employees, the increased mix of food sales, and the impact of taking full ownership of the mainland China stores late last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially all of Starbucks’ operating income decline was related to its U.S. operations. Americas segment operating margin declined 2.9 percentage points to 21.5%, and operating income fell $66 million, while operating income increased in all of Starbucks’ other segments. Consolidated operating income declined $6 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the earnings call, CFO Scott Maw said that the increased expense in the quarter was a product of several things, including planned increased spending on employees, the impact of higher food mix, planned investments in technology, and the impact of the May 29 U.S. store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>
Blame It on Frappuccino and No Coffee Culture?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maw also said that management now expects its full-year comps to come in slightly below the low end of the company’s 3%-5% growth range, as its expectations are relatively muted for the fiscal fourth quarter. This is likely driven by continued unexpected weakness in sales of its blended Frappuccino beverages, which have declined 3% in 2018, after growing 17%, 5%, and 4% in the prior three fiscal years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, non-coffee beverages, including Teavana-branded teas, continue to perform well, as do sales of food. Teavana and refreshment beverages have increased at least 12% for four consecutive years, and were up 14% year-to-date through May 2018, while food has accounted for 22% of sales this year. On the earnings call, management said that it was seeing growth in every beverage segment, and food, with the exception of Frappuccino. Unfortunately, the positive results from its other products are not enough to offset weak Frappuccino sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management is clearly concerned about comps in China, but its bigger focus is on store expansion. The company aims to expand from 3,000 stores in 100 cities at recent count, to 6,000 stores in 230 cities by 2022. On the earnings call, China CEO Belinda Wong emphasized that China is still a developing coffee market, and that a big part of the company’s long-term success there will be tied to its ability to expand the market and continue introducing more and more people to coffee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the company moves closer to fiscal year-end, it continues to tweak its earnings guidance. Management revised guidance for GAAP earnings up from $3.23-$3.26 per share to $3.26-$3.28 per share, and tightened the non-GAAP range from $2.39-$2.43 per share to $2.40-$2.42 per share. And as discussed above, global comps are expected to be at the lower end of the 3%-5% range next quarter and below 3% for the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management also committed to taking steps in fiscal 2019 to drive better returns, including accelerating the closure of underperforming company-owned stores and focusing new expansion on its best markets, while opening fewer licensed stores in the U.S. China, on the other hand, is set to see an acceleration of new store expansion, with the company planning to increase its pace by 20% starting next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are legitimate challenges in front of Starbucks, including retail weakness in the U.S. and speed bumps in China as it aggressively develops that largely untapped market. But with a powerful brand and history of excellent operating results, I wouldn’t count the coffee giant out just yet. After all, sales and earnings — as we just saw — continue to grow, and its powerful economic model generates substantial cash flow that it’s increasingly returning to shareholders.</p>

Unfortunately, the positive results from its other products are not enough to offset weak Frappuccino sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management is clearly concerned about comps in China, but its bigger focus is on store expansion. The company aims to expand from 3,000 stores in 100 cities at recent count, to 6,000 stores in 230 cities by 2022. On the earnings call, China CEO Belinda Wong emphasized that China is still a developing coffee market, and that a big part of the company’s long-term success there will be tied to its ability to expand the market and continue introducing more and more people to coffee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the company moves closer to fiscal year-end, it continues to tweak its earnings guidance. Management revised guidance for GAAP earnings up from $3.23-$3.26 per share to $3.26-$3.28 per share, and tightened the non-GAAP range from $2.39-$2.43 per share to $2.40-$2.42 per share. And as discussed above, global comps are expected to be at the lower end of the 3%-5% range next quarter and below 3% for the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management also committed to taking steps in fiscal 2019 to drive better returns, including accelerating the closure of underperforming company-owned stores and focusing new expansion on its best markets, while opening fewer licensed stores in the U.S. China, on the other hand, is set to see an acceleration of new store expansion, with the company planning to increase its pace by 20% starting next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are legitimate challenges in front of Starbucks, including retail weakness in the U.S. and speed bumps in China as it aggressively develops that largely untapped market. But with a powerful brand and history of excellent operating results, I wouldn’t count the coffee giant out just yet. After all, sales and earnings — as we just saw — continue to grow, and its powerful economic model generates substantial cash flow that it’s increasingly returning to shareholders.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expectations were pretty muted for Starbucks [stock display="(NASDAQ:SBUX)" symbol="SBUX" type="bar" ] heading into its fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings report, released on July 26 after market close. This was in large part because the company already let the cat out of the bag, pre-reporting a handful of metrics on June 19, sending the stock price down sharply and making some of today’s earnings release little more than a formality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are a handful of things in the earnings release and from the analyst call that bear a closer look, including more detail on the company’s ongoing struggle with sales at stores open more than one year, — called comps — what’s happening with China, — its biggest growth market — and more detail on the company’s plans to increase returns and lower costs going forward. Let’s dig into the latest release for more insight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>A Record Quarter, but Traffic Was Down and Expenses Are Up</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starbucks reported record third quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 11% from last year, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 and adjusted EPS of $0.62, up 30% and 13%, respectively, year over year. Comps increased 1% on a consolidated basis, a further slowing of growth from the 2% comps increase in both the first and second quarters of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A closer look at comps offers some reason for concern. In prior years, Starbucks was able to consistently grow comps at or above — in some cases well above — 3%, from a mix of higher traffic and bigger tickets. However, over the past year, traffic has been relatively flat, while bigger tickets have done all the heavy lifting. Unfortunately, it’s starting to look like Starbucks is developing a traffic problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a breakdown of comps by geographical segment last quarter:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:block {"ref":18} /--></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the table shows, Starbucks sold more goods — or higher-priced goods — to fewer customers in every market last quarter. But there is some additional context to consider. On the earnings call, Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said that a decline in Frappuccino sales and the May 29 anti-bias training closure took a three-point bite out of the Americas segment, though only about one-half point of that was due to the store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comps in China fell 2% in the quarter, a sharp turn negative after what had been steady positive growth. This weak result caused the CAP segment to report negative comps in the quarter, driven by a 3% decline in transactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Operating margins also declined in the quarter, falling from 18.4% last year to 16.5%. The company said the decline was a product of higher spending on store employees, the increased mix of food sales, and the impact of taking full ownership of the mainland China stores late last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially all of Starbucks’ operating income decline was related to its U.S. operations. Americas segment operating margin declined 2.9 percentage points to 21.5%, and operating income fell $66 million, while operating income increased in all of Starbucks’ other segments. Consolidated operating income declined $6 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the earnings call, CFO Scott Maw said that the increased expense in the quarter was a product of several things, including planned increased spending on employees, the impact of higher food mix, planned investments in technology, and the impact of the May 29 U.S. store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>
Blame It on Frappuccino and No Coffee Culture?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maw also said that management now expects its full-year comps to come in slightly below the low end of the company’s 3%-5% growth range, as its expectations are relatively muted for the fiscal fourth quarter. This is likely driven by continued unexpected weakness in sales of its blended Frappuccino beverages, which have declined 3% in 2018, after growing 17%, 5%, and 4% in the prior three fiscal years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, non-coffee beverages, including Teavana-branded teas, continue to perform well, as do sales of food. Teavana and refreshment beverages have increased at least 12% for four consecutive years, and were up 14% year-to-date through May 2018, while food has accounted for 22% of sales this year. On the earnings call, management said that it was seeing growth in every beverage segment, and food, with the exception of Frappuccino. Unfortunately, the positive results from its other products are not enough to offset weak Frappuccino sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management is clearly concerned about comps in China, but its bigger focus is on store expansion. The company aims to expand from 3,000 stores in 100 cities at recent count, to 6,000 stores in 230 cities by 2022. On the earnings call, China CEO Belinda Wong emphasized that China is still a developing coffee market, and that a big part of the company’s long-term success there will be tied to its ability to expand the market and continue introducing more and more people to coffee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the company moves closer to fiscal year-end, it continues to tweak its earnings guidance. Management revised guidance for GAAP earnings up from $3.23-$3.26 per share to $3.26-$3.28 per share, and tightened the non-GAAP range from $2.39-$2.43 per share to $2.40-$2.42 per share. And as discussed above, global comps are expected to be at the lower end of the 3%-5% range next quarter and below 3% for the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management also committed to taking steps in fiscal 2019 to drive better returns, including accelerating the closure of underperforming company-owned stores and focusing new expansion on its best markets, while opening fewer licensed stores in the U.S. China, on the other hand, is set to see an acceleration of new store expansion, with the company planning to increase its pace by 20% starting next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are legitimate challenges in front of Starbucks, including retail weakness in the U.S. and speed bumps in China as it aggressively develops that largely untapped market. But with a powerful brand and history of excellent operating results, I wouldn’t count the coffee giant out just yet. After all, sales and earnings — as we just saw — continue to grow, and its powerful economic model generates substantial cash flow that it’s increasingly returning to shareholders.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expectations were pretty muted for Starbucks [stock display="(NASDAQ:SBUX)" symbol="SBUX" type="bar" ] heading into its fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings report, released on July 26 after market close. This was in large part because the company already let the cat out of the bag, pre-reporting a handful of metrics on June 19, sending the stock price down sharply and making some of today’s earnings release little more than a formality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are a handful of things in the earnings release and from the analyst call that bear a closer look, including more detail on the company’s ongoing struggle with sales at stores open more than one year, — called comps — what’s happening with China, — its biggest growth market — and more detail on the company’s plans to increase returns and lower costs going forward. Let’s dig into the latest release for more insight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>A Record Quarter, but Traffic Was Down and Expenses Are Up</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starbucks reported record third quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 11% from last year, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 and adjusted EPS of $0.62, up 30% and 13%, respectively, year over year. Comps increased 1% on a consolidated basis, a further slowing of growth from the 2% comps increase in both the first and second quarters of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A closer look at comps offers some reason for concern. In prior years, Starbucks was able to consistently grow comps at or above — in some cases well above — 3%, from a mix of higher traffic and bigger tickets. However, over the past year, traffic has been relatively flat, while bigger tickets have done all the heavy lifting. Unfortunately, it’s starting to look like Starbucks is developing a traffic problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a breakdown of comps by geographical segment last quarter:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:block {"ref":18} /--></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the table shows, Starbucks sold more goods — or higher-priced goods — to fewer customers in every market last quarter. But there is some additional context to consider. On the earnings call, Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said that a decline in Frappuccino sales and the May 29 anti-bias training closure took a three-point bite out of the Americas segment, though only about one-half point of that was due to the store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comps in China fell 2% in the quarter, a sharp turn negative after what had been steady positive growth. This weak result caused the CAP segment to report negative comps in the quarter, driven by a 3% decline in transactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Operating margins also declined in the quarter, falling from 18.4% last year to 16.5%. The company said the decline was a product of higher spending on store employees, the increased mix of food sales, and the impact of taking full ownership of the mainland China stores late last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially all of Starbucks’ operating income decline was related to its U.S. operations. Americas segment operating margin declined 2.9 percentage points to 21.5%, and operating income fell $66 million, while operating income increased in all of Starbucks’ other segments. Consolidated operating income declined $6 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the earnings call, CFO Scott Maw said that the increased expense in the quarter was a product of several things, including planned increased spending on employees, the impact of higher food mix, planned investments in technology, and the impact of the May 29 U.S. store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>
Blame It on Frappuccino and No Coffee Culture?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maw also said that management now expects its full-year comps to come in slightly below the low end of the company’s 3%-5% growth range, as its expectations are relatively muted for the fiscal fourth quarter. This is likely driven by continued unexpected weakness in sales of its blended Frappuccino beverages, which have declined 3% in 2018, after growing 17%, 5%, and 4% in the prior three fiscal years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, non-coffee beverages, including Teavana-branded teas, continue to perform well, as do sales of food. Teavana and refreshment beverages have increased at least 12% for four consecutive years, and were up 14% year-to-date through May 2018, while food has accounted for 22% of sales this year. On the earnings call, management said that it was seeing growth in every beverage segment, and food, with the exception of Frappuccino. Unfortunately, the positive results from its other products are not enough to offset weak Frappuccino sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management is clearly concerned about comps in China, but its bigger focus is on store expansion. The company aims to expand from 3,000 stores in 100 cities at recent count, to 6,000 stores in 230 cities by 2022. On the earnings call, China CEO Belinda Wong emphasized that China is still a developing coffee market, and that a big part of the company’s long-term success there will be tied to its ability to expand the market and continue introducing more and more people to coffee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the company moves closer to fiscal year-end, it continues to tweak its earnings guidance. Management revised guidance for GAAP earnings up from $3.23-$3.26 per share to $3.26-$3.28 per share, and tightened the non-GAAP range from $2.39-$2.43 per share to $2.40-$2.42 per share. And as discussed above, global comps are expected to be at the lower end of the 3%-5% range next quarter and below 3% for the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management also committed to taking steps in fiscal 2019 to drive better returns, including accelerating the closure of underperforming company-owned stores and focusing new expansion on its best markets, while opening fewer licensed stores in the U.S. China, on the other hand, is set to see an acceleration of new store expansion, with the company planning to increase its pace by 20% starting next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are legitimate challenges in front of Starbucks, including retail weakness in the U.S. and speed bumps in China as it aggressively develops that largely untapped market. But with a powerful brand and history of excellent operating results, I wouldn’t count the coffee giant out just yet. After all, sales and earnings — as we just saw — continue to grow, and its powerful economic model generates substantial cash flow that it’s increasingly returning to shareholders.</p>

On the earnings call, Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said that a decline in Frappuccino sales and the May 29 anti-bias training closure took a three-point bite out of the Americas segment, though only about one-half point of that was due to the store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comps in China fell 2% in the quarter, a sharp turn negative after what had been steady positive growth. This weak result caused the CAP segment to report negative comps in the quarter, driven by a 3% decline in transactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Operating margins also declined in the quarter, falling from 18.4% last year to 16.5%. The company said the decline was a product of higher spending on store employees, the increased mix of food sales, and the impact of taking full ownership of the mainland China stores late last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially all of Starbucks’ operating income decline was related to its U.S. operations. Americas segment operating margin declined 2.9 percentage points to 21.5%, and operating income fell $66 million, while operating income increased in all of Starbucks’ other segments. Consolidated operating income declined $6 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the earnings call, CFO Scott Maw said that the increased expense in the quarter was a product of several things, including planned increased spending on employees, the impact of higher food mix, planned investments in technology, and the impact of the May 29 U.S. store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>
Blame It on Frappuccino and No Coffee Culture?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maw also said that management now expects its full-year comps to come in slightly below the low end of the company’s 3%-5% growth range, as its expectations are relatively muted for the fiscal fourth quarter. This is likely driven by continued unexpected weakness in sales of its blended Frappuccino beverages, which have declined 3% in 2018, after growing 17%, 5%, and 4% in the prior three fiscal years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, non-coffee beverages, including Teavana-branded teas, continue to perform well, as do sales of food. Teavana and refreshment beverages have increased at least 12% for four consecutive years, and were up 14% year-to-date through May 2018, while food has accounted for 22% of sales this year. On the earnings call, management said that it was seeing growth in every beverage segment, and food, with the exception of Frappuccino. Unfortunately, the positive results from its other products are not enough to offset weak Frappuccino sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management is clearly concerned about comps in China, but its bigger focus is on store expansion. The company aims to expand from 3,000 stores in 100 cities at recent count, to 6,000 stores in 230 cities by 2022. On the earnings call, China CEO Belinda Wong emphasized that China is still a developing coffee market, and that a big part of the company’s long-term success there will be tied to its ability to expand the market and continue introducing more and more people to coffee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the company moves closer to fiscal year-end, it continues to tweak its earnings guidance. Management revised guidance for GAAP earnings up from $3.23-$3.26 per share to $3.26-$3.28 per share, and tightened the non-GAAP range from $2.39-$2.43 per share to $2.40-$2.42 per share. And as discussed above, global comps are expected to be at the lower end of the 3%-5% range next quarter and below 3% for the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management also committed to taking steps in fiscal 2019 to drive better returns, including accelerating the closure of underperforming company-owned stores and focusing new expansion on its best markets, while opening fewer licensed stores in the U.S. China, on the other hand, is set to see an acceleration of new store expansion, with the company planning to increase its pace by 20% starting next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are legitimate challenges in front of Starbucks, including retail weakness in the U.S. and speed bumps in China as it aggressively develops that largely untapped market. But with a powerful brand and history of excellent operating results, I wouldn’t count the coffee giant out just yet. After all, sales and earnings — as we just saw — continue to grow, and its powerful economic model generates substantial cash flow that it’s increasingly returning to shareholders.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expectations were pretty muted for Starbucks [stock display="(NASDAQ:SBUX)" symbol="SBUX" type="bar" ] heading into its fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings report, released on July 26 after market close. This was in large part because the company already let the cat out of the bag, pre-reporting a handful of metrics on June 19, sending the stock price down sharply and making some of today’s earnings release little more than a formality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are a handful of things in the earnings release and from the analyst call that bear a closer look, including more detail on the company’s ongoing struggle with sales at stores open more than one year, — called comps — what’s happening with China, — its biggest growth market — and more detail on the company’s plans to increase returns and lower costs going forward. Let’s dig into the latest release for more insight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>A Record Quarter, but Traffic Was Down and Expenses Are Up</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starbucks reported record third quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 11% from last year, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 and adjusted EPS of $0.62, up 30% and 13%, respectively, year over year. Comps increased 1% on a consolidated basis, a further slowing of growth from the 2% comps increase in both the first and second quarters of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A closer look at comps offers some reason for concern. In prior years, Starbucks was able to consistently grow comps at or above — in some cases well above — 3%, from a mix of higher traffic and bigger tickets. However, over the past year, traffic has been relatively flat, while bigger tickets have done all the heavy lifting. Unfortunately, it’s starting to look like Starbucks is developing a traffic problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a breakdown of comps by geographical segment last quarter:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:block {"ref":18} /--></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the table shows, Starbucks sold more goods — or higher-priced goods — to fewer customers in every market last quarter. But there is some additional context to consider. On the earnings call, Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer said that a decline in Frappuccino sales and the May 29 anti-bias training closure took a three-point bite out of the Americas segment, though only about one-half point of that was due to the store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comps in China fell 2% in the quarter, a sharp turn negative after what had been steady positive growth. This weak result caused the CAP segment to report negative comps in the quarter, driven by a 3% decline in transactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Operating margins also declined in the quarter, falling from 18.4% last year to 16.5%. The company said the decline was a product of higher spending on store employees, the increased mix of food sales, and the impact of taking full ownership of the mainland China stores late last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Essentially all of Starbucks’ operating income decline was related to its U.S. operations. Americas segment operating margin declined 2.9 percentage points to 21.5%, and operating income fell $66 million, while operating income increased in all of Starbucks’ other segments. Consolidated operating income declined $6 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the earnings call, CFO Scott Maw said that the increased expense in the quarter was a product of several things, including planned increased spending on employees, the impact of higher food mix, planned investments in technology, and the impact of the May 29 U.S. store closure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maw also said that management now expects its full-year comps to come in slightly below the low end of the company’s 3%-5% growth range, as its expectations are relatively muted for the fiscal fourth quarter. This is likely driven by continued unexpected weakness in sales of its blended Frappuccino beverages, which have declined 3% in 2018, after growing 17%, 5%, and 4% in the prior three fiscal years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, non-coffee beverages, including Teavana-branded teas, continue to perform well, as do sales of food. Teavana and refreshment beverages have increased at least 12% for four consecutive years, and were up 14% year-to-date through May 2018, while food has accounted for 22% of sales this year. On the earnings call, management said that it was seeing growth in every beverage segment, and food, with the exception of Frappuccino. Unfortunately, the positive results from its other products are not enough to offset weak Frappuccino sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Management is clearly concerned about comps in China, but its bigger focus is on store expansion. The company aims to expand from 3,000 stores in 100 cities at recent count, to 6,000 stores in 230 cities by 2022. On the earnings call, China CEO Belinda Wong emphasized that China is still a developing coffee market, and that a big part of the company’s long-term success there will be tied to its ability to expand the market and continue introducing more and more people to coffee.</p>

Management revised guidance for GAAP earnings up from $3.23-$3.26 per share to $3.26-$3.28 per share, and tightened the non-GAAP range from $2.39-$2.43 per share to $2.40-$2.42 per share. And as discussed above, global comps are expected to be at the lower end of the 3%-5% range next quarter and below 3% for the year.</p>

<ul><li>Lemonade’s market opportunity exceeds $400 billion, and its AI-powered business model differentiates it from other insurance companies.</li><li>Lemonade stock could grow tenfold by 2031.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Insurance is one of the largest industries in the world, generating over $5 trillion&nbsp;in premiums each year. But it's also a highly fragmented industry. In fact, many of today's leaders have been around for a century or longer, and none has more than 4% market share. Moreover, these titanic enterprises were built on old technologies, meaning they weren't designed&nbsp;for state-of-the-art data science.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But&nbsp;<meta charset="utf-8">[stock display="<strong>Lemonade</strong>" symbol="LMND" type="bar" ](<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/lemonade-inc/lmnd/">NYSE:LMND</a>)&nbsp;was built for big data.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Lemonade's market opportunity</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lemonade is an AI-powered insurance company. Its digital-first, mobile-friendly platform currently offers homeowners, renters, pet, and term life policies across the United States, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. And recently, the company announced Lemonade Car, an auto insurance product slated to launch in the near future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collectively, management puts Lemonade's market opportunity at over $400 billion, and $300 billion of that figure comes from Lemonade Car. That means this new product could be a significant catalyst in the years ahead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Lemonade's advantages</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lemonade has two key advantages, and the first relates to data. Case in point: Legacy insurance companies ask 20 to 50 questions on a typical homeowners policy form, meaning they collect 20 to 50 data points. By comparison, Lemonade's digital platform surfaces 1,700 details, and the application process takes just two minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How is that possible? Lemonade uses AI chatbots to engage consumers, and its platform was designed for types of data&nbsp;that legacy systems can't capture. For instance, in addition to the standard questions, Lemonade also collects details like time of day, type of device, and length of time spent on the application. Using these clues, the company can predict risk by making correlations between seemingly unrelated data points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, this advantage should allow Lemonade to underwrite policies&nbsp;and detect fraud&nbsp;more effectively than its rivals. Put another way, its loss ratio (i.e. the percentage of premiums paid out in claims) should be lower than average, meaning the company should keep more cash. That, in turn, should drive lower prices for consumers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lemonade's second advantage is its unique business model. The bottom line is black and white for traditional insurers: Collect premiums and pay claims and expenses, and anything left over is profit. Of course, that creates a conflict of interest, as there is an incentive to deny claims.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To solve this problem, Lemonade takes a fixed-fee approach. In a nutshell, it keeps 25% of premiums, then uses the rest to cover claims and expenses. And if anything is left over, Lemonade donates the money to charity. That means the company doesn't benefit from denying claims, at least not to the same extent as legacy insurance providers. Put another way, Lemonade's values are better aligned with those of its clients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Lemonade's financial performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's still early, but Lemonade's financial performance shows promise. Its gross loss ratio dropped from 113% in 2018 to 71% in 2020, though it did spike to 121% in Q1 2021. However, that was due entirely to winter storm Uri in Texas, a market where Lemonade's business has historically been highly concentrated. On the bright side, the company is diversifying a little more each year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More importantly, if you exclude the impact of those catastrophic losses, Lemonade's loss ratio would have been 71%&nbsp;last quarter -- roughly 11 percentage points lower than the industry average. That suggests that Lemonade's AI-powered platform is indeed more efficient than legacy systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More importantly, consumers love Lemonade. According to a report from Clearsurance, Lemonade is the most highly rated provider of homeowners and renters policies, and I think the company can take the top spot in the auto category after the launch of Lemonade Car.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not surprisingly, Lemonade's ability to delight consumers has translated into significant demand, as evidenced by the company's rapid growth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table {"className":"is-style-stripes"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Q1 2019 (TTM)</th><th>Q1 2021 (TTM)</th><th>CAGR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Customers</td><td>371,571</td><td>1,096,618</td><td>72%</td></tr><tr><td>Gross profit</td><td>$4.4 million</td><td>$22.1 million</td><td>124%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DATA SOURCE: LEMONADE&nbsp;SEC FILINGS. TTM = TRAILING-12-MONTHS. CAGR = COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking ahead, Lemonade certainly faces some tough competition, and the stock currently trades at a very pricey 55&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/price-to-sales-ratio-value-stocks/">times sales</a>. But disruptive tech companies often face similar situations, and none of those hurdles are insurmountable.</p>

<p>More to the point, Lemonade is building its business around big data, and I believe that will give the company a sustainable advantage. That should help Lemonade capture a good chunk of its enormous market opportunity. That's why&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/07/30/growth-stock-could-make-you-a-millionaire-zillow/">this growth stock could grow tenfold by 2031</a>.This article represents the opinion of the writer, who may disagree with the “official” recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service. We’re motley! Questioning an investing thesis -- even one of our own -- helps us all think critically about investing and make decisions that help us become smarter, happier, and richer.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starbucks is a company that really needs no introduction, especially given that this is our second go-around. Allow me though to work in a bit of a golf analogy (as the snow flies outside the window) to outline our thought process that surrounded re-recommending this global behemoth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For whatever reason, the collection of ideas that surfaced among the team for this month’s U.S. recommendation took the form of a 280-yard par 4 in the mind of yours truly. The golfers out there will know that this kind of approximate yardage generally represents a hole that can be played two ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One way is to pull out the driver, swing with all of one’s might, and try to knock it on the green, setting up what’s likely to be a lengthy eagle putt—at best. It’s a “highest risk/highest reward” type scenario. The other way to play is to hit the ball 160 yards or so into the fairway, then play a nice full wedge into the green, ideally setting up a makeable birdie putt—lower risk but still high reward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You see, it takes all shapes and sizes to build a portfolio. The same goes for the game of golf, where you need to be able to apply any number of shots under all kinds of scenarios. In our opinion though, all portfolios need foundation-like positions from which to build. These generally fit under the “lower risk/high reward” sweet spot—a sweet spot often reserved for the very best companies in the world, of which [stocks type="bar" symbol="SBUX" display="<strong>Starbucks</strong>"] (NASDAQ:SBUX) certainly counts itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few “drive-the-green” ideas were kicked around by the team, but in the end, we’re more than settled with the more conservative, yet potentially very rewarding idea that is Starbucks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a></a>Recap</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our thesis is very much as it was in our first recommendation, but after a quick review, we’re going to drill into what continues to evolve as the big opportunity in front of this company, along with one metric that we think will support this stock very nicely under more adverse market conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Much of our original thesis was centred on the international opportunity in front of Starbucks, and this will be the area that we’re going to dive into in a moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First though, I’d like to highlight that what we termed “arguably the largest risk shareholders face” in the original recommendation back in October 2016 has, in some respects, occurred. That risk was the departure of founder, then CEO, and significant shareholder ($2.1 billion worth) Howard Schultz. Now, “departure” probably isn’t the right word, as Schultz remains the executive chairman and has taken the development of higher-end Starbucks shops—Starbucks Reserve Roastery—under his wing. But he is no longer the company’s CEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The company’s former COO, Kevin Johnson, has moved into the corner suite, so to speak, and for better or worse, the market more or less gave this development a collective shrug. Perhaps it’d have been a different story if Schultz had left all together, but regardless, we like it when perceived risks don’t turn out as badly as imagined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a></a>The Opportunity</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Schultz has his sleeves rolled up in developing the Roastery angle—an immaterial piece at this stage—the opportunity that we’ll focus on is the one that exists in China.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a company that throughout its life has been absolutely tremendous at generating an outsized return on its capital (relative to much of the business world). And that capital cannon, if you will, is currently pointed straight in the direction of China, where it was recently reported that a new Starbucks is opening every 15 hours!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the end of the last quarter, Starbucks had almost 3,000 stores in China, 550 more than at the beginning of 2017 and well on track to achieve its goal of 5,000 by 2020. The company has spent the better part of two decades crafting the perfect coffeehouse experience in China. These are efforts that are set to pay off in a major way over the next several years. Looking out further, Schultz believes Starbucks’s business in China will eventually exceed the company’s U.S. business, and he is on the record stating, “We are building one of the most respected and iconic brands in the country … I believe China will be as large, or larger, than the U.S. business in the future.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Should this occur, we believe the current stock price represents a fantastic point of entry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a></a>One Key Metric</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Historically, Starbucks has more or less represented the definition of a growth company—with the returns to prove it. And given the China opportunity especially, Starbucks remains firmly in growth mode. However, while the growth engine continues to purr, Starbucks has also become not just a dividend payer, but a dividend grower. And currently, the yield that’s on offer is about as good as it’s ever been at 2.1% or so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since instituting a dividend in 2010, Starbucks has increased its annual payouts from $0.18 to the current $1.20 per share. This represents a payout ratio of just 55% of trailing 12-month free cash flow, which indicates that we can expect this dividend growth to continue. Particularly when we consider the company spent about $2 billion repurchasing its stock during the last fiscal year. Recall: these folks know what they’re doing when it comes to capital allocation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How this serves as potential support for the stock is that based on history, there’s little justification for Starbucks to provide investors with a dividend yield that’s much higher than it currently stands. If the stock sells off for any reason, that yield will move higher, but that, in turn, is likely to attract buyers, keeping the slide in check.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Turning this around, should the stock return to a more mean-like yield of 1.5%, the stock price would have to be $80—40% higher than the current level. And if the dividend payment continues higher—a likely scenario, in our opinion—so too does the potential for capital appreciation based on this metric alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a></a>Risks and Considerations</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similar risks and considerations remain as they were in our first recommendation. Short term, the market is ever focused on the company’s same-store-sales (SSS) figure, and therefore, quarterly results can cause the stock to get a bit whippy. We pay this no mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bigger picture, rapid growth—regardless of the industry—is a challenge. The execution risk associated with something like coffee versus say, burritos (ahem, Chipotle) is seemingly far less and more focused on marketing/brand awareness, but no doubt, Starbucks could stub a toe, or three, as it pursues this Chinese opportunity. We’ll be mindful of this as we go, but to this point, it’s been a relatively pain-free expansion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a></a>Foolish Bottom Line</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because we’re so aligned with the original recommendation, I’m going to borrow from the close. If we cared a lick about what the SSS print might be in the next quarter or a year from now, I’m not sure we’d be recommending this company. But for those willing to ignore the noise and recognize the opportunity that’s in front of this company, and the ground work in place to ensure it comes to fruition, this is every bit as good a time to begin building a position as it was in October 2016. And similar to the intro note, if you’re moving capital from more speculative positions to begin this build, even better. While the market is focused on the here and now, we see great things transpiring for both the company and the stock for the next decade and beyond. And thus we’re very happy to be ordering up another round of shares. Join us!</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Lemonade’s market opportunity exceeds $400 billion, and its AI-powered business model differentiates it from other insurance companies.</li><li>Lemonade stock could grow tenfold by 2031.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Insurance is one of the largest industries in the world, generating over $5 trillion&nbsp;in premiums each year. But it's also a highly fragmented industry. In fact, many of today's leaders have been around for a century or longer, and none has more than 4% market share. Moreover, these titanic enterprises were built on old technologies, meaning they weren't designed&nbsp;for state-of-the-art data science.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But&nbsp;<meta charset="utf-8">[stock display="<strong>Lemonade</strong>" symbol="LMND" type="bar" ](<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/lemonade-inc/lmnd/">NYSE:LMND</a>)&nbsp;was built for big data. Here's why this stock could grow tenfold over the next decade.<img srcset="https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A//g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/636619/investor-8.jpg&amp;w=300&amp;op=resize 300w, https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A//g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/636619/investor-8.jpg&amp;w=1000&amp;op=resize 1000w, https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A//g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/636619/investor-8.jpg&amp;w=2000&amp;op=resize 2000w" alt="Investor looking at upward trending chart." src="https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F636619%2Finvestor-8.jpg&amp;w=700&amp;op=resize"></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Lemonade's market opportunity</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lemonade is an AI-powered insurance company. Its digital-first, mobile-friendly platform currently offers homeowners, renters, pet, and term life policies across the United States, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. And recently, the company announced Lemonade Car, an auto insurance product slated to launch in the near future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collectively, management puts Lemonade's market opportunity at over $400 billion, and $300 billion of that figure comes from Lemonade Car. That means this new product could be a significant catalyst in the years ahead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Lemonade's advantages</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lemonade has two key advantages, and the first relates to data. Case in point: Legacy insurance companies ask 20 to 50 questions on a typical homeowners policy form, meaning they collect 20 to 50 data points. By comparison, Lemonade's digital platform surfaces 1,700 details, and the application process takes just two minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How is that possible? Lemonade uses AI chatbots to engage consumers, and its platform was designed for types of data&nbsp;that legacy systems can't capture. For instance, in addition to the standard questions, Lemonade also collects details like time of day, type of device, and length of time spent on the application. Using these clues, the company can predict risk by making correlations between seemingly unrelated data points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, this advantage should allow Lemonade to underwrite policies&nbsp;and detect fraud&nbsp;more effectively than its rivals. Put another way, its loss ratio (i.e. the percentage of premiums paid out in claims) should be lower than average, meaning the company should keep more cash. That, in turn, should drive lower prices for consumers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lemonade's second advantage is its unique business model. The bottom line is black and white for traditional insurers: Collect premiums and pay claims and expenses, and anything left over is profit. Of course, that creates a conflict of interest, as there is an incentive to deny claims.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To solve this problem, Lemonade takes a fixed-fee approach. In a nutshell, it keeps 25% of premiums, then uses the rest to cover claims and expenses. And if anything is left over, Lemonade donates the money to charity. That means the company doesn't benefit from denying claims, at least not to the same extent as legacy insurance providers. Put another way, Lemonade's values are better aligned with those of its clients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Lemonade's financial performance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's still early, but Lemonade's financial performance shows promise. Its gross loss ratio dropped from 113% in 2018 to 71% in 2020, though it did spike to 121% in Q1 2021. However, that was due entirely to winter storm Uri in Texas, a market where Lemonade's business has historically been highly concentrated. On the bright side, the company is diversifying a little more each year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More importantly, if you exclude the impact of those catastrophic losses, Lemonade's loss ratio would have been 71%&nbsp;last quarter -- roughly 11 percentage points lower than the industry average. That suggests that Lemonade's AI-powered platform is indeed more efficient than legacy systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More importantly, consumers love Lemonade. According to a report from Clearsurance, Lemonade is the most highly rated provider of homeowners and renters policies, and I think the company can take the top spot in the auto category after the launch of Lemonade Car.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not surprisingly, Lemonade's ability to delight consumers has translated into significant demand, as evidenced by the company's rapid growth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table {"className":"is-style-stripes"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Q1 2019 (TTM)</th><th>Q1 2021 (TTM)</th><th>CAGR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Customers</td><td>371,571</td><td>1,096,618</td><td>72%</td></tr><tr><td>Gross profit</td><td>$4.4 million</td><td>$22.1 million</td><td>124%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DATA SOURCE: LEMONADE&nbsp;SEC FILINGS. TTM = TRAILING-12-MONTHS. CAGR = COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking ahead, Lemonade certainly faces some tough competition, and the stock currently trades at a very pricey 55&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/price-to-sales-ratio-value-stocks/">times sales</a>. But disruptive tech companies often face similar situations, and none of those hurdles are insurmountable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More to the point, Lemonade is building its business around big data, and I believe that will give the company a sustainable advantage. That should help Lemonade capture a good chunk of its enormous market opportunity. That's why&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/07/30/growth-stock-could-make-you-a-millionaire-zillow/">this growth stock could grow tenfold by 2031</a>.This article represents the opinion of the writer, who may disagree with the “official” recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service. We’re motley! Questioning an investing thesis -- even one of our own -- helps us all think critically about investing and make decisions that help us become smarter, happier, and richer.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dividend stock investing is relatively simple to learn for all walks of life. So, no matter if you are newly retired, just had a kid, or are a high school student who wants to invest the savings from your summer job, dividend investing can work beautifully for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are thousands of stocks to choose from. To save time and immediately filter for potential quality dividend stocks, start selecting from the Canadian Dividend Aristocrat list. This list consists of dividend stocks that have increased their dividends for at least five years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Learn from dividend stock Fortis</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the best examples for learning is&nbsp;<strong>Fortis</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-fts-fortis-inc/1308/">(TSX:FTS)</a><a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nyse-fts-fortis-inc/272762/">(NYSE:FTS)</a>&nbsp;stock. The dividend stock is quality in a number of ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, it has one of the longest streaks of dividend growth among public Canadian stocks. It has raised its dividend for almost half a century!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, by observing its earnings history for at least the past 10 years, which covers an economic cycle, we find out that it has highly stable earnings. Specifically, its earnings per share only dropped in one year — and only by 1%. There was one year where its earnings were flat, while the other years witnessed earnings growth. This means that the dividend stock could maintain its dividend as long as it keeps a sustainable payout ratio.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of its highly stable earnings, Fortis’s payout ratio of about 75% of earnings is sufficient to protect its dividend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fortis stock’s 10-year dividend-growth rate is 5.6%. It targets to increase its payout by about 6% per year through 2025. The consistent rate of 5-6% signifies the predictability of the regulated electric and gas utility. Management didn’t just project it for the next two years, which, again, suggests a low-risk, highly predictable business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Digging a little deeper into the business, you can see why it’s low risk. It’s a regulated utility with defined returns on equity on its assets. Moreover, it is largely made of distribution and transmission assets that have little uncertainty. Its $19.6 billion 2021-2025 capital plan includes two-thirds of distribution and transmission projects, which supports the overweight in those assets. Management sees this capital plan driving low-risk rate base growth of roughly 6%, which matches with the projected dividend-growth rate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Fortis stock’s valuation&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You want to pay for a low valuation to maximize your yield and total returns. However, the market rarely provides opportunities to buy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.ca/2021/07/29/3-key-takeaways-from-fortis-tsxfts-earnings-this-morning/">Fortis stock</a>&nbsp;at a bargain. In fact, the dividend stock commands a premium valuation because of its low risk and high quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, its long-term normal price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is about 19.4. You would be very lucky to pick up some Fortis shares at a P/E of about 18, which is approximately $49 per share based on this year’s estimated earnings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a dividend stock as low uncertainty as Fortis, you can use its recent yield history as a guide for when to buy. Its five-year yield history suggests that you should buy the stock whenever it yields +4%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><strong>The Foolish investor takeaway</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New investors can choose low-risk, quality dividend stocks from the Canadian Dividend Aristocrat list to begin their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.ca/investing/dividend-investing-canada/">dividend investing</a>&nbsp;journey. With a focus on dividend safety, dividend growth, business quality, and valuation, you should be able to generate long-term returns of +7% while earning a growing dividend income.</p>

However, the market rarely provides opportunities to buy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.ca/2021/07/29/3-key-takeaways-from-fortis-tsxfts-earnings-this-morning/">Fortis stock</a>&nbsp;at a bargain. In fact, the dividend stock commands a premium valuation because of its low risk and high quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, its long-term normal price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is about 19.4. You would be very lucky to pick up some Fortis shares at a P/E of about 18, which is approximately $49 per share based on this year’s estimated earnings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a dividend stock as low uncertainty as Fortis, you can use its recent yield history as a guide for when to buy. Its five-year yield history suggests that you should buy the stock whenever it yields +4%.</p>

<p>Both&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Micro Devices&nbsp;</strong>(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/advanced-micro-devices-inc/amd/">NASDAQ:AMD</a>)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Nvidia&nbsp;</strong>(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/nvidia-corporation/nvda/">NASDAQ:NVDA</a>)&nbsp;have had an extremely positive week, with shares of AMD reaching all-time highs during open market hours on August 4 and Nvidia shares close to the same goal. In today's video I look at the recent news that could be driving this positive momentum for both AMD and Nvidia. Here are some highlights from the video:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>On July 26 AMD reported strong earnings, which has triggered numerous analysts to increase the price targets for AMD. Nvidia has also seen increased price target hikes even though its earnings are scheduled for August 16, 2021. Analysts may be bullish for Nvidia after AMD reported a strong quarter.&nbsp;</li><li>On August 3 AMD announced that its new high-performance graphics cards are now available on<strong>&nbsp;Apple</strong>'s&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/apple-inc/aapl/">NASDAQ:AAPL</a>)&nbsp;Mac Pros. On July 29 AMD also announced the release date of its budget-friendly gaming graphics card.&nbsp;</li><li>On August 2 Nvidia announced the availability of its Base Command Platform, a product aimed at enterprise companies that want instant access to powerful computing. The service is a subscription-based model starting at $90,000 a month with a three-month minimum contract.&nbsp;</li></ol>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>TELUS</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-t-telus-corporation/499/">(TSX:T)</a><a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nyse-tu-telus-corp-usa/1741/">(NYSE:TU)</a>&nbsp;has a very&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.ca/investing/how-to-find-an-undervalued-stocks/">diverse portfolio of services and solutions</a>&nbsp;and recently reported higher revenues. This was driven by a combination of TELUS’ smart technology and security solutions, the resilient performance of TELUS’ TI University in the Philippines, increased revenues from the hyper-scaling of TELUS’ &nbsp;virtual care solutions, and the growing scale of TELUS Agriculture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Deriving shareholder value</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Further, TELUS’ has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.ca/2021/07/31/better-5g-stock-telus-tsxt-or-rogers-tsxrci-b/">deriving shareholder value</a>&nbsp;from the company’s leadership in social capitalism. Even in challenging times, TELUS’ has consistently returned significant capital to shareholders, while maintaining a robust balance sheet, making generational investments in advanced broadband technologies, and advancing the company’s social purpose through community investment and philanthropy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first quarter of 2020, after thoughtfully weighing the interests of TELUS’s many stakeholders, alongside the countless initiatives TELUS undertook in response to the health crisis, the company decided to defer a scheduled dividend increase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, in November, TELUS was able to resume the company’s multi-year dividend growth program with a seven percent increase to the company’s annualized dividend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Consistent performance and cash flow generation</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This dividend increase was a reflection of TELUS’s confidence in the company’s strong and consistent performance and cash flow generation. This was its 19th dividend increase since the establishment of the company’s first three-year program a decade ago. Notably, since 2004, TELUS has returned over $19 billion to shareholders, including $14 billion in dividends, representing approximately $15 per share.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>TELUS understands the importance of dividend income to the millions of citizens who own TELUS shares, including middle-income Canadians and pensioners who rely on this form of income for a livelihood, as these investments help consumers and businesses thrive. Since 2000, TELUS has paid approximately $46 billion in total tax and spectrum remittances to the company’s federal, provincial and municipal governments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Supporting fiscal investments</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These funds support fiscal investments in roads and bridges, public education, healthcare, cultural pursuits, and national defence. In several ways, TELUS continues to sustain industry leadership relative to the company’s global peers and delivers sustainable results for the benefit of the many stakeholders it serves.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, TELUS’ leadership in customer service, network excellence, investor value creation, and social capitalism differentiates it from the company’s peers, globally. As the world looks ahead toward a period of economic and social recovery and inspired by the TELUS team’s strong performance in 2020, TELUS has established new community giving, social impact, and financial targets for the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, TELUS looks all set to continue delivering leading operational and financial results. This should lead to a higher valuation and stock price. Long-term shareholders could handsomely benefit from income and capital appreciation.</p>
